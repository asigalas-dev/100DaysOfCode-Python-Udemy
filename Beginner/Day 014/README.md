## Day 14 of 100

### Project Name: Higher or Lower

#### **Project functionality:**
- A Higher or Lower game where players compare two public figures and guess who has more followers on social media. Each round presents two choices (A and B), displaying their name, profession, and country. Players must select the option with the higher follower count. If correct, their score increases, and the higher-ranked choice carries over to the next round. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess, at which point their final score is displayed. The program ensures a smooth user experience by clearing the screen between rounds and using articles ("a" or "an") correctly for better readability
