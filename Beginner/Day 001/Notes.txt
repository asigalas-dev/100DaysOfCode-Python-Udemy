Inputs
Variables
	- Calculating length of string within variables or on their own
	- Creating temporary variables
	- Swapping two variable contents
Variable Naming
Debugging
Commenting

------------

Terms learned:

print ( ) - function

"..." - string

"...\n" - creating a new line within our string

"Hello" + " Wolrd" - combing strings (The space in " World" is important for our output to have a space

input ( ) - function
	- input looks exactly like the print function but instead the string used acts as a prompt to the user as to what kind of data we want

A way to use the input that was given by the user is to concatenate it within our string. An example would be the following:
	print("Hello " + input("What is your name? ") + "!")
	That starts by the input and then prints whatever we asked

# - to add a comment you add the hashtag sign and then write your comment
	- you can also make the whole line a comment by clicking anywhere on the line and pressing "CTRL+/"
	- by pressing it again you can removed the comment

variable - giving a label to a piece of data so that we refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name
	name = input("What is your name?") - in this example we take the input and we assign it to the variable "name"
	- as the name suggests, variables can vary and if we initiate a different input, they can change their value

len( ) - that can calculate the length of the string by either including a string already or calculating it through a variable
	- eg. 	len("hello")
		len(variable)

temp = - that is creating a temporary variable to store one of our variables and then recall it

var1, var2 = var2, var1 - that is a way to swap variable contents

variable naming - make sure you make your code readable with variables that make sense when you can back to them

variable naming rules - can use multiple words but no spacing
	- words can be separated with an underscore "_"
	- can have numbers but not in the beginning of the name
