### Project Name: Blackjack (Capstone Project)

#### **Project functionality:**
- A command-line Blackjack game where the player competes against the computer. The player starts with two cards and can choose to hit or stand. Aces adjust dynamically from 11 to 1 if the total score exceeds 21. The dealer draws until reaching at least 17, following standard casino rules. The game checks for Blackjack, busts, and winning conditions, displaying results accordingly. The screen clears between games for a smooth experience, and players can continue playing until they choose to exit
