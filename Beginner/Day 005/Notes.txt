Day 5 of 100: Notes

------------

Concepts learned:

Loops
	- For Loop
	- For Loop with Range Function
Sum
Max / Min
Shuffle list items
Join list items

------------

Terms learned:

loops - loops allow us to tell the computer to repeat actions without having to write repeated code. If we wanted the computer to print out 1 through to 100, it would very painful to type a print statement for every number, or even just typing out all the numbers 1 through to 100. Loops allow us to create a rule and the computer can follow it to do a repeated action
for loop - one way to represent a loop is with a for loop. It would look something like this
		for <variable name of each item> in <a List>:
    		<do something>
    		<do something else>

		an example can be
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)
This will go to each and every item on the list of fruits, assign it to the new variable fruit and print it. The outcome would look like this
Apple
Peach
Pear
sum - python has lots of built-in functions to help us work with numbers. One of them helps us calculate the sum (the total). e.g.
student_scores = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
total_score = sum(student_scores)
But how does sum() work behind the scenes? The code is written by the people who developed Python and it might look something like this:
student_scores = [180, 124, 165]
sum = 0
for score in student_scores:
	sum += score
print(sum)
max / min - there are also a built-in Python methods called max() and min(), which allow you to pass in a List of numbers, and it will give you the highest number or the lowest number
range() - the combination of the range() function with the Python For Loop allows us to run a loop for as many times as we wish. Instead of looping through each item in a List, we can loop through a range of numbers
	an example can be
for number in range (a, b):
	print(number)
this does not include b. For example range (1, 10) would print 1 to 9
if I want all the number of the range, I have to set it to + 1
	an example can be
num1 = int(input("What is your first number?\n"))
num2 = int(input("What is your second number?\n"))
for number in range (num1, num2 + 1):
	print(number)
if I wanted to add a step between the number I have to add another comma with the number of the step
	an example can be
for number in range (1, 11, 3):
	print(number)
this would print
1
4
7
10
random.shuffle() - it shuffles the contents of a list
''.join(list_name) - it joins the contents of a list. Inside '' you can put anything you want. 
	an example can be
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(''.join(letters))
	would print abc
if you were to type
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(', '.join(letters))
	it would a, b, c
