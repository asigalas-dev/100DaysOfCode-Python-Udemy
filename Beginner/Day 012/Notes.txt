- Local Scope
- Global Scope
- Namespace
- Block Scope
- Global Variables
- Global Constants

----------------------

Key Terms & Explanations:
----------------------

Local Scope:
----------------------
- **Variables (or functions) declared inside a function** have **local scope**.
- They can only be accessed **within the function** where they are defined.

- **Example: Local Scope**

    def my_function():
        my_local_var = 2

    # This will cause a NameError because my_local_var is not accessible outside the function
    print(my_local_var)

Global Scope:
----------------------
- **Variables or functions declared at the top level** (unindented) have **global scope**.
- **They are accessible anywhere in the file**.

- **Example: Global Scope**

    my_global_var = 3

    def my_function():
        # Works fine since my_global_var is global
        print(my_global_var)

Namespace:
----------------------
- **A namespace is the context in which a name (variable, function, etc.) exists.**
- Every variable or function has a **namespace** that determines where it can be accessed.

Block Scope:
----------------------
- Unlike many other languages, **Python does not have block scope**.
- Variables created inside loops, `if` statements, or `while` loops are **not restricted to those blocks**.
- If they are **inside a function**, they have **function scope**.
- If they are **outside a function**, they have **global scope**.

- **Example: No Block Scope in Python**

    # Accessible anywhere
    my_global_var = 1

    def my_function():
        # Only accessible within my_function()
        my_local_var = 2

    for _ in range(10):
        # Still accessible outside the loop (not block-scoped)
        my_block_var = 3

Global Variables:
----------------------
- By default, Python **does not allow modifying a global variable inside a function**.
- To modify a **global variable inside a function**, use the **`global` keyword**.

- **Example: Global Variable (Incorrect Usage – Causes an Error)**

    a = 1

    def my_function():
        a += 1  # ❌ This causes an error
        print(a)

- **Example: Global Variable (Correct Usage with `global`)**

    a = 1

    def my_function():
        global a  # Declare that we are modifying the global variable
        a += 1
        print(a)

Global Constants:
----------------------
- **Global constants are values that should not be modified after they are set.**
- They are written in **ALL_CAPS** with underscores `_` to separate words.

- **Example: Defining Global Constants**

    PI = 3.14159
    GOOGLE_URL = "https://www.google.com"

- These are meant to be **"set and forget"** values for easy reference.
