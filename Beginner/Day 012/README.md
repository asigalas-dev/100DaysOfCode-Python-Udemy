## Day 12 of 100

### Project Name: Guess the Number

#### **Project functionality:**
- A Guess the Number game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy (10 attempts) and hard (5 attempts). After each guess, the program provides feedback—indicating whether the guess is too high or too low—and reduces the number of remaining attempts. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts, in which case the correct answer is revealed. The interface is clean, with a logo display and clear prompts, ensuring an engaging and interactive user experience
- There are two solution files included for this exercise with two different ways of creating this game
