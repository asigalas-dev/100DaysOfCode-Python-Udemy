### Project Name: Hirst Painting Generator

#### **Project functionality:**
- A Hirst Painting Generator that uses Python's Turtle module to create a dot painting inspired by artist Damien Hirst. The program randomly selects colors from a predefined color palette and draws a 10x10 grid of colored dots. Each dot is spaced evenly apart, creating a visually appealing pattern. The Turtle graphics library handles the drawing, with the turtle moving without visible lines to speed up rendering. The screen remains open until the user clicks to exit, ensuring an interactive viewing experience

#### **Concepts Learned:**
- Turtle Graphics
- Tuples
- Importing Modules
