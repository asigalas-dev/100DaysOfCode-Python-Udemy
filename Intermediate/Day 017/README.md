### Project Name: OOP Quiz Game

#### **Project functionality:**
- A quiz game where users answer True or False questions. The game dynamically fetches trivia questions from an API (Open Trivia Database) based on the user's chosen difficulty level, category, and number of questions. The questions are stored as objects using OOP principles, and a QuizBrain class manages the game flow. Users receive immediate feedback on their answers, along with their current score. The game continues until all questions are answered, after which the final score is displayed. The program ensures smooth user interaction and structured code for scalability

#### **Concepts Learned:**
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
