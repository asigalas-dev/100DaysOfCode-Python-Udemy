### Project Name: OOP Coffee Machine

#### **Project functionality:**
- A coffee machine simulator using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The program is structured into different classes (Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker, MoneyMachine) to improve modularity and maintainability. Users can order espresso, latte, or cappuccino, with the system handling resource management, payment processing, and order fulfillment. The program includes options to check reports, restock ingredients, and turn off the machine. By leveraging OOP principles, the code is more scalable, organized, and easier to modify for future enhancements

#### **Concepts Learned:**
