### Project Name: Turtle Racing Game

#### **Project functionality:**
- A Turtle Racing Game where players bet on which racer will reach the finish line first. The game features eight racers, each represented by a different color and shape, including characters like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo, Master Splinter, April, Shredder, and Krang. Players enter their bet by selecting the initial of their chosen racer, and the race begins once a bet is placed. Each racer moves randomly, making the outcome unpredictable. Once a racer crosses the finish line, the program announces the winner's name and color, letting the player know if they guessed correctly or not. The game runs in a Turtle graphics window and closes upon user interaction
